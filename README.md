# Use Cases

In this repository we would like to collect use cases where browsers communicate with web-server-capable
via HTTP and/or WebSocket over TLS, for the purpose of clarifying network and security requirements.

If you find another use case, please submit a Pull Request to add it to [UseCases.md](UseCases.md), or add your comment
to relevant GitHub issues.

The following are the documents derived from the discussions on the use cases. Please also submit a Pull Request, or add your comment.

* [Requiremens.md](Requirements.md) - functional and non-functional requirements of HTTPS/WSS in local network
* [RelevantSpecs.md](RelevantSpecs.md) - existing specifications and drafts relevant to HTTPS/WSS in local network
* [Certificates.md](Certificates.md) - types of server certificate used for HTTPS/WSS in local network
* [NetworkBasedAPI.md](NetworkBasedAPI.md) - how HTTPS in local network can mitigate the security risk on Network based API
* [RelevantIETFDocuments.md](RelevantIETFDocuments.md) - existing IETF documents relevant to
in local network via HTTP and/or WebSocket over TLS
